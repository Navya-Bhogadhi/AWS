    <h2>Deployment Models</h2>

   <pre>
         The AWS Cloud offers three cloud deployment models: <mark>Cloud, Hybrid, and On-Premises</mark>. 
       1. Cloud-based applications are fully deployed in the cloud and do not have any parts that run on premises.
       2. A hybrid deployment connects infrastructure and applications between cloud-based resources and existing resources that are not in the cloud, such as on-<br> premises resources.  
       3. However, a hybrid deployment is not equivalent to an on-premises deployment because it involves resources that are located in the cloud.

<pre>
      How does the scale of cloud computing help you to save costs?- The aggregated cloud usage from a large number of customers results in lower pay-as-you-go prices.
      Not having to invest in technology resources before using them relates to Trade upfront expense for variable expense.
      Accessing services on-demand to prevent excess or limited capacity relates to Stop guessing capacity.
      Quickly deploying applications to customers and providing them with low latency relates to Go global in minutes.
